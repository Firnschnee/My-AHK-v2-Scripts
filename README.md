## My AHK v2 Scripts

Collection of AutoHotkey v2 scripts for Windows 11 quality-of-life improvements.

## The Problem

ISO-DE (QWERTZ / German) keyboards make many special characters hard to reach:
- `AltGr + Q = @` is awkward
- `Ctrl + Z = Undo` instead of `Ctrl + Y` (I mean.. why? It would be so much more easier to reach, right next to `Ctrl + X`, `Ctrl + C` and `Ctrl + V`)

This script also remaps `AltGr` combinations to `Alt` for easier access.

## What's included

**Undo-Shortcut-Fix**
- `Ctrl + Y` = Undo

**Special Characters (System-wide)**
- `Alt + Q = @`, `Alt + E = €`, `Alt + M = µ`, etc.
- `Alt + 2/3/7/8/9/0/ß/+ = ² ³ { [ ] } \ ~`
- Works everywhere

**Firefox Tab Navigation**
- `Alt + A` = Previous tab
- `Alt + D` = Next tab
- `Alt + W` = Restore closed tab

**Excel Sheet Navigation**
- `Alt + A` = Previous sheet
- `Alt + D` = Next sheet

**Windows Virtual Desktop**
- `Win + A` = Previous desktop
- `Win + D` = Next desktop
